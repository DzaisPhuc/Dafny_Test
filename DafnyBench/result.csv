2,Reverse Array,V4,"Success (Verified)","Fixed after specific Human Hint. The model correctly added the symmetry invariant (linking 'left' and 'right' indices) only after being explicitly prompted about the missing index relationship.",4
3,Binary Search,V1,"Error: assertion might not hold (in Test methods)","Weak Postcondition. The method failed to promise (ensure) that the returned index actually points to the target key, or that returning -1 implies the key is truly missing. Thus, the test cases could not verify the results.",1
3,Binary Search,V2,"Error: assertion might not hold (TestBinarySearch only)","Over-specified Test / Ambiguous Return. The test expects a specific index (e.g., index == 2), but the specification only guarantees that *an* index containing the key is returned. Dafny cannot prove uniqueness of the index without stronger constraints.",2
3,Binary Search,V3,"Error: assertion might not hold (Test only)","Missing Completeness Specification. The method ensures safety (result is correct if found) but fails to ensure completeness (must find the element if it exists). Dafny assumes returning -1 is valid even for existing elements, causing the test assertion to fail.",3
3,Binary Search,V4,"Error: assertion might not hold (Test failed)","Failed Verification of Completeness. Even with explicit prompts, the model could not generate the complex 'Window Invariants' required to prove that if the key exists, it *must* be found inside the shrinking [low, high] window. Therefore, Dafny still believes the method might incorrectly return -1.",4
3,Binary Search,V5,"Error: assertion might not hold (Test failed)","Structural Logic Failure. Although the model added correct 'element properties' invariants (left < key, right > key), it failed to link the indices themselves (`low <= high + 1`). Without this structural invariant, the verifier cannot trust the loop termination state implies the element is truly missing.",5

5,Array Sum,V1,"Error: Loop invariant violation & Post-condition failure","Weak Mathematical Induction. The model failed to provide a strong invariant linking the partial sum to the array sequence. It also used outdated null-checking syntax for non-nullable array types, showing a lack of awareness of modern Dafny constraints.",1
5,Array Sum,V2,"Error: Assertion failure (Tests) & Lemma verification failed","Proof Decomposition Failure. The model failed the inductive step in its mathematical Lemma (SumSeqAppendLemma). Additionally, it provided postconditions too weak for the Test assertions to satisfy the solver, and failed to account for array slice stability.",2
5,Array Sum,V3,"Error: Invariant maintenance & Postcondition failure","Inductive Step Gap. Despite using ghost variables and assertions, the solver failed to link the sequence slice 's[..i+1]' to 'TotalSum'. This is due to the solver's inability to automatically perform induction on sequence concatenation without an explicit trigger or a more stable framing.",3
5,Array Sum,V4,"Success (Verified)","Structural Logic Alignment. The model successfully verified the code after providing an explicit trigger for sequence extensionality (assert s[..i+1][..i] == s[..i]).

9,K-th Smallest,V3,"Error: Postcondition could not be proved","Quantifier Complexity. The model attempted to prove that 'exactly K-1 elements' are smaller using 'forall' over two arrays. However, it lacked the 'counting' logic or lemmas to bridge the partition boundaries to the final result.",3

11,Dutch National Flag,V3,"Error: Post-condition violation","Partition Property Failure. The model adjusted boundaries to mid <= high + 1 but failed to prove that elements swapped to the end were strictly 2s (forall k :: high < k < a.Length ==> a[k] == 2).",3
11,Dutch National Flag,V4,"Error: Assertion violation (Permutation)","Multiset Logic Failure. To prove the array is a permutation, Dafny requires proof that the multiset is preserved during swaps. Claude failed to provide the necessary intermediate assertions or ghost updates.",4
11,Dutch National Flag,V5,"Error: Logic Breakdown / Timeout","Structural Collapse. In the final attempt, the model overloaded the Z3 solver with redundant asserts. It incorrectly updated boundaries (e.g., high := mid - 1 instead of high - 1), leading to total logical failure.",5
